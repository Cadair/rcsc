# Comments and documentation

## Commenting code

- Confirm comment character if haven't seen it already (unlikely)
- Purpose of comments
- Where/why/how to write comments
- cat/dog picture
- go back through code and make sure it's commented

## Documentation

- Broad concept of why there should be docs (large scale)
- smaller scale reasons for having docs
- docstrings, etc
- go back through code and doc it
- see docstring challenges in swc function material
